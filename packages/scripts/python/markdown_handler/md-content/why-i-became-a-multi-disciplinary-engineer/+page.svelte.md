summary: As a mechanical engineer, I've always been fascinated by the idea of creating a virtual world that mimics reality. It all started when I first learned to code and had the dream of building a complete virtual world that one could dive into and live in. I was driven by the idea that in a virtual world, time could be accelerated and everything could be controlled, making it possible to create a unique and immersive experience.

As a mechanical engineer, I've always been fascinated by the idea of creating a virtual world that mimics reality. It all started when I first learned to code and had the dream of building a complete virtual world that one could dive into and live in. I was driven by the idea that in a virtual world, time could be accelerated and everything could be controlled, making it possible to create a unique and immersive experience.

In pursuit of this goal, I embarked on a journey of learning. I started with Python as my entry into programming, and then ventured into fields like Blender, Linux, and web development. I realized that to create a virtual world, I would need to master not just one field but several, including AI, Blockchain, Web Development, and Product Design.

That's when I decided to become a multi-disciplinary engineer. I wanted to be able to build a virtual world that was not only beautiful but also functional, secure, and scalable. I wanted to bring my dream to life and make it accessible to others, which is why I pursued a career in mechanical engineering, specializing in product design. I also delved into the world of blockchain to ensure the virtual world would have a secure and decentralized economy, and I started learning AI so that the virtual world could be overseen by an intelligent and efficient algorithm.

Now, as a senior-level web developer and a mechanical engineer with expertise in blockchain and AI, I am well on my way to bringing my dream to life. But it hasn't been easy, and I've learned so much along the way. In this blog, I will be sharing my journey as a multi-disciplinary engineer, exploring the intersections of AI, Blockchain, Web Development, and Product Design, and sharing my experiences and lessons learned.

All that's left is neural science. Of course, without having to split a human's skull.

Join me on my journey and let's unleash the full potential of multi-disciplinary engineering together.
